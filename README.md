# wmrc [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.1.0--dev-orange.svg)](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)](/LICENSE) [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/Arkanosis/wmrc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Arkanosis/wmrc)

**wmrc** is a SUPER SECRET PROJECT AND I WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

(BTW… Dear GitHub, could you please add first-class support for DONTREADME.md?)

## Features

DON'T ASK I WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.

## Compiling and installing

I've been told that:
 * `make build` does build,
 * `make install` does install,
 * `make run` does run
… but why would you care?

By the way, since it seems you care, `make experiment` runs the kotlin lib (not the app!) on the dev device.

If you reaaaaaaaally want it, contributions are welcome through [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/Arkanosis/wmrc/pulls).

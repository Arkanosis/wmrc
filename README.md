**wmrc** is a SUPER SECRET PROJECT AND I WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

(BTW… Dear GitHub, could you please add first-class support for DONTREADME.md?)

## Features

DON'T ASK I WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.

## Compiling and installing

I've been told `JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jre/ ./gradlew :app:uninstallDebug :app:installDebug` does compile and install on your target device, but why would you care?

By the way, since it seems you care, `JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jre/ ./gradlew :lib:run` runs the kotlin lib (not the app!) on dev device.
